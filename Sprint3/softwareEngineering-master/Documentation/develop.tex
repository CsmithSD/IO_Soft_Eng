\chapter{Development Environment}

\section{Development IDE and Tools}
Qt Creator served as the primary IDE for writing the source code. However, a custom Makefile was used to compile the program with gcc. That makefile is included in this source package. Vim and gedit were used as text editors.

\section{Source  Control}
This project made use of a Github repository for source control. Since this project was done for a class at SDSMT, the source code is not in the public domain. Therefore, the git repository is private. For access, contact Joseph Lillo at joseph.lillo@mines.sdsmt.edu.

\section{Dependencies}
Dependencies for compiling this source code includes the POSIX programming API and the C standard library.


\section{Build  Environment}
This program compiles into a single executable file (Grade) from a single source code file (grade.cpp). 

\section{Development Machine Setup}
This program was developed in Linux version 3.14.1 with gcc version 4.9.0.
\\Machines running the same or greater versions with the dependencies listed above will correctly build this program.
