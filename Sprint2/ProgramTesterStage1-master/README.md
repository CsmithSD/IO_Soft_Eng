What the program does:

    The Program will then ask if you want to generate test cases and to enter y for yes and n for no.
    
    If it is y then it will ask for type and it wants int or float to be entered.
    
    It then will generate test files and answer files using the golden.cpp file
    
    If n or after test and answer files are generated the program will then run the cpp files against all test files it can find.
    
    after the program has created all the log files and summary files it will ask the user if they would like all files that were generated
    for the generated test and answer files to be deleted. y if yes and anything else for no.
