\chapter{Release -- Setup -- Deployment}
The test suite will be released in three main phases. Firstly, we released a test suite which would run a given cpp against all test files in the directory and all sub-directories. This second release runs multiple cpp files against tests stored in a test sub-directory. The third phase has not been discussed yet. The final deployment will be the end of the semester.


\section{Deployment Information and Dependencies}
The test suite is a Linux specific program, thus it requires the user to run it on a Linux OS. The final deployment, as mentioned above, will be the end of the semester.  



\section{Setup Information}
To install the test suite one must access the Intolerable Optimists' Github account and pull down the cpp file. Once done the cpp file needs to be moved to the directory where the test directory and student directories are. There is a makefile that goes along with this program so the user need only type make on the command line.



\section{System  Versioning Information}
There are currently only two main versions of this program version 1.0 and 1.2. There are a few sub-versions from changes that were lumped into the releases at the end of each sprint. 
Version 1.0 consists of the first sprint and version 1.2 is, of course, the second sprint. There will be a version 1.3 for the third sprint.
