\section{Major Component \#1 }

\subsection{Technologies  Used}
Text editor used was Vim. Development was done on the Linux OS.

\subsection{Component  Overview}
Testing Suite for C++ programs.

\subsection{Phase Overview}
Initial phase for testing suite. Suite runs a single executable compiled from a *.cpp file against *.tst files.

\subsection{ Architecture  Diagram}
Compile a *.cpp file passed as a command line argument. Run that executable against all *.tst files within the
current directory and all of its sub-directories.


\subsection{Data Flow Diagram}
Input is redirected from the *.tst file and output is redirected to a *.out file. The *.out file is compared to the
corresponding *.ans file. The results are printed in a *.log file.
