\chapter{System  and Unit Testing}



\section{Overview}
Some of the functionality was independently tested apart from the completed program.
The completed program was run against several test files in their respective directories.



\section{Dependencies}
The program requires *.tst and *.ans files that are either in the same directory as the *.cpp file or in
a sub-directory of that directory.


\section{Test Setup and Execution}
Dr. Logar provided several test files and directories for the program to process. The executable was copied into each
of the directories containing a *.cpp file to test against.
