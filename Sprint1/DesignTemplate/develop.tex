\chapter{Development Environment}
The basic purpose for this section is to give a developer all of the necessary 
information to setup their development environment to run, test, and/or develop. 


\section{Development IDE and Tools}
Our developmentenviornment was the  Linux package installed on our tablets curtiosy of the ACM. We also used vim and gedit as text editors for this project.

\section{Source  Control}
We started out using bitbucket for our source control but switched over to gitbucket for more uniformity with the class. 

\section{Dependencies}
There were no major dependencies for this project. The main dependency is the OS we operate on. The code for the test suite is Linux specific.

\section{Build  Environment}
The build enviornment uses the gcc command to complie the program. A make file has been made so the user need only type make.

\section{Development Machine Setup}
Intentionally left blank. This is because we are dependent on the Linux distribution from the ACM.
