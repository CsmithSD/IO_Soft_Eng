\chapter{Project Overview}
We are a team of three: Charles, Chris, and Jarod. Together we are designing a test suite. It will be able to run tests against students programs and grade them by comparing their answers to those generated by the testing suite, which will also be able to generate its own tests should the user decide. 



\section{Team Members and Roles}
Charles Parsons is the Product Owner. He does all interaction with the customer, in this case Dr. Logar. He also makes sure the team delivers what he has agreed to with the customer.

Christopher Smith is our Scrum Master. He keeps the team on tract making sure we meet our deadlines. He is also responsible for making sure the Agile process is adhered to as much as possible.

Jarod Hogan is the Technical Lead. He is responsible for making sure the program is being done in the way agreed upon by the team. He also communicates any major problems or roadblocks in accomplishing the task as far as the software is concerned. 


\section{Project  Management Approach}
This project will be managed using the Scrum 'flavor' of the Agile process. We will follow the requirements of daily scrum meetings, as well as evaluation meetings throughout each sprint and especially at the end. Trello will be used to help manage each person and their tasks. GitHub is to be utilized to keep each team member up to date as to what each person has accomplished.


\section{Phase  Overview}
The First phase of our testing suite was to have it running a C++ program against all test cases contained in the current directory as well as each subdirectory. The test cases ended with the extension .tst. It also generated at file containing the
results of each test run and stored them in a file.

The Second phase of our testing suite was to have it generate its own tests and answers and then grade multiple programs based on their accuracy to match the answer files. This required a bit of reworking since we now need to compile and run many C++ programs and run them against tests contained in a specific directory.Also each program is stored in its own directory.
