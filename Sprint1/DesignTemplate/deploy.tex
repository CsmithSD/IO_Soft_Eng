\chapter{Release -- Setup -- Deployment}
The release date will be the final turn in date for this program at the end of the semester. We have multiple smaller releases where we send out what has been completed at the end of each sprint. 


\section{Deployment Information and Dependencies}
Main dependencies are the Linux operating system, C++ programs, and a basic knowledge of command line compiling. The code will be compiled using a makefile so all the user need do is to pull the code off of github onto their linux device. 



\section{Setup Information}
The test suite should reside in the root directory in which the student and test directories are contained. There also needs to be a golden.cpp in the root directory to generate the answer files to each test file generated by the suite.



\section{System  Versioning Information}
There will be at least three major versions tothis program. The first is a program which compiles and runs a given .cpp file and runs it against all test files in a directory and subdirectory.
The second version consists of some automatic test generating as well as searching for .cpp files in subdirectories belonging to each student of a class.
