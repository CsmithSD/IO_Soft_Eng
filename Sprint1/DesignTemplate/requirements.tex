\chapter{User Stories, Backlog and Requirements}
\section{Overview}


This system is for professors to test their students' programs against test data contained in text files. The results of these
tests will then be written to a text file for th user to evaluate the tested programs performance.

 Title: Dr. Logar's User Story
As a professor I want to have a program compile, run, test, and evaluate the tests run on a program submitted to me by 
my students so that I no longer have to run each test case individually and evaluate them by hand.


The progam should compile and run a program against all test cases contained in files ending in ".tst" within the current 
directory or within a subdirectory. In addition, it will evaluate the passes and fails of the program and log this in a text 
document for user review.


\subsection{Scope}
The purpose of this project is to create a program that will run another program against test documents and output the 
results into another file forthe user. The program is specifically geared toward computer science professors for their use in 
grading student programs. This program will compile and run the submitted program imputting the test data. The results, which are saved to a text document, are evaluated and and percentage of pass/fail is also computed and saved in the
document.

What scope does this document cover?  This document would contain stakeholder information, 
initial user stories, requirements, proof of concept results, and various research 
task results. 



\subsection{Purpose of the System}
This system is designed in order to make it easier for professors to grade their students programs. The test files need only be 
in the same directory (or within a subdirectory) as the program to be compiled and run. Also, the output is to be detailed 
enough so that the user knows exactly which test cases passed and which failed.


\section{ Stakeholder Information}


There are only two main stake holders in this project. The first is Dr, Logar, our customer, who naturally expects a working
progam. The second stake holder is this team who greatly desires an A in this course.


\subsection{Customer or End User (Product Owner)}
Dr. Logar is our customer and end user in this case.  

\subsection{Management or Instructor (Scrum Master)}
Cris Smith is our Scrum Master. He plans the time line we are to follow as well as the scrum meetings 


\subsection{Investors}
There are no Investors.


\subsection{Developers --Testers}
There is not set developer(s) or tester(s). We divide up the work as evenly as possible. After running our own tests on our 
code we are sure to test the finished product to ensure integrating the code was successful.


\section{Business Need}
This program is aimed at reducing the amount of time a professor must personally spend on each program by automating
the test phase.

\section{Requirements and Design Constraints}
The main constraint of this program is that it must run on a Linux based operating system and be used to compile C++
programs. Other constraints are that this program does require a basic knowledge of command line compiling.


\subsection{System  Requirements}
The system requirements are that only C++ programs be used with this project on a Linuz machine.


\subsection{Network Requirements}
There are no network requirements as everything can be done offline.


\subsection{Development Environment Requirements}
Our developement enviornment is Linux using simple text editors with g++ compile command.


\subsection{Project  Management Methodology}
The stakeholders might restrict how the project implementation will be managed. 
 There may be constraints on when design meetings will take place.  There might 
be restrictions on how often progress reports need to be provided and to whom. 
 
\begin{itemize}
\item What system will be used to keep track of the backlogs and sprint status?
\item Will all parties have access to the Sprint and Product Backlogs?
\item How many Sprints will encompass this particular project?
\item How long are the Sprint Cycles?
\item Are there restrictions on source control? 
\end{itemize}

\section{User Stories}




\subsection{User Story \#1}
 Title: Dr. Logar's User Story
As a professor I want to have a program compile, run, test, and evaluate the tests run on a program submitted to me by 
my students so that I no longer have to run each test case individually and evaluate them by hand. 

\subsubsection{User Story \#1 Breakdown}
This user story is very straight forward yet complex. The first major requirement is we compile and run a program automatically. Secondly the output must be evaluated and a report prepared for the user.

\subsection{User Story \#2} 
Titile: Revisions to make life  easier. It is also desired that this test suite runs all test files contained in a test directory against each program submitted by a student. Each student will have their own directory where the result file should be stored. 

\subsubsection{User Story \#2 Breakdown}
The important information contained here is how we traverse the file structure and where we find test cases and store the results.

\subsection{User Story \#3} 
Title: Automatic tests. As I am quite busy I would like to have the test suite generate its own tests so that I don't have to. It will store these tests in the tests subdirectory and generate the answer file for each test. 


\subsubsection{User Story \#3 Breakdown}
This is pretty simple and straightforward. All that needs doing running a program against randomly generated test cases.
